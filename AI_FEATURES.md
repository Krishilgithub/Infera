## üõ† Technical Implementation

### API Integration

```typescript
// OpenRouter client configuration
const client = new OpenRouterClient({
	apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
	baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
});
```

### Transcription Hook

```typescript
const { isRecording, isTranscribing, error, startRecording, stopRecording } =
	useTranscription({
		continuous: true,
		onTranscription: handleTranscription,
	});
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```typescript
const { analyzeSentiment } = useSentimentAnalysis();
const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(transcribedText);
```

### Speaker Identification

```typescript
const { identifySpeaker, registerSpeaker } = useSpeakerIdentification();
const speaker = await identifySpeaker(audioBuffer);
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

Add your OpenRouter API key to `.env.local`:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-api-key-here
```

### 2. Starting AI Features

1. Join a meeting via `/dashboard/live`
2. Click the AI toggle button to enable AI features
3. Click the AI transcription button (sparkles icon) to start recording
4. View real-time transcription, sentiment, and insights in the sidebar

### 3. AI Insights Dashboard

- View live action items as they're identified
- Monitor key decisions made during the meeting
- Track identified risks and potential issues
- See topics discussed and speaking time distribution
- Export meeting summaries and insights

### 4. Jargon Assistant

- Technical terms are automatically detected
- Click on jargon terms for contextual explanations
- Build a meeting-specific glossary
- Copy or save explanations for future reference

## üîß Configuration Options

### Transcription Settings

```typescript
{
  continuous: true,          // Continuous recording
  language: 'en',           // Language preference
  confidenceThreshold: 0.7  // Minimum confidence for display
}
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```typescript
{
  realtime: true,           // Real-time analysis
  emotionDetection: true,   // Include emotion analysis
  contextWindow: 5          // Sentences for context
}
```

### Speaker Identification

```typescript
{
  voiceprintSensitivity: 0.7, // Matching threshold
  autoRegister: true,         // Auto-register new speakers
  maxSpeakers: 10            // Maximum tracked speakers
}
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Audio Processing

- Uses Web Audio API for real-time audio capture
- Processes audio in chunks for efficiency
- Implements audio compression for API transmission

### API Rate Limits

- Implements request queuing for API calls
- Uses debouncing for sentiment analysis
- Batches insight extraction requests

### Browser Compatibility

- Requires modern browsers with MediaRecorder support
- Uses Progressive Web App features for optimal performance
- Fallback UI for unsupported features

## üîê Privacy & Security

### Data Handling

- Audio data is processed in real-time and not permanently stored
- Transcriptions are temporarily cached for session analysis
- No personal voice data is retained after meetings end

### API Security

- All API calls use secure HTTPS endpoints
- API keys are server-side only, never exposed to client
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and controls costs

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Multi-language Support**: Expand beyond English transcription
2. **Custom Jargon Libraries**: User-defined terminology databases
3. **Meeting Templates**: Pre-configured analysis for different meeting types
4. **Integration APIs**: Connect with calendar and task management systems
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed meeting performance metrics
6. **Offline Mode**: Local processing for sensitive environments

### AI Model Upgrades

- Integration with newer Whisper models as they become available
- Enhanced emotion recognition with computer vision
- Custom fine-tuning for industry-specific terminology
- Improved speaker diarization accuracy

## ü§ù Contributing
